            <h2>Redeemer</h2>
    
            <p>In the past, I have often connected to word, Redeemer, to Jesus Christ. This semester, Redeemer has grown to have a deeper meaning for me as I have learned
                about the connections "redemption" has to the Jewish culture and doctrine. One of these was the principles of redeeming people back to the land of their fathers.
            </p>
                
            <p> Back in the time of the Exodus, God's covenant with the Israelites promised them that they would be redeemed to their land.
                The covenant people believed this land was a huge part of their identity, and God showed His power with his ability to redeem His people 
                back to their sacred land after escaping from the Egyptians. Because of this event, redemption became a core teaching they taught about.
            </p>

            <p>The people of Isaiah's time also had someone that would be given the role of "redeemer" in their community. His job was to give financial help
               to those that had lost their fortunes or had financial confusion, especially in the case of death. This was often referred to "redeeming" someone to their inheritance.
               Because of the role this person had and the redemption they received of their land, the people often didn't often associate redemption and redeeming with our relationship with God.
            </p>

            <p>Through the teachings of Isaiah, the prophet, we get much of the teachings that God will also redeem His people spiritually. To illustrate this point, the word redeem/redeemer 
                was only used <strong>17 times</strong> in the King James Version of the Bible, <strong>12 references</strong> come from Isaiah. 5 are specifically 
                found in Isaiah 47-54, which is also the most quoted chapters in the Book of Mormon.
            </p>

            <p>The Nephite people connected deeply with this idea because they often felt lost. Because of their departure from the land of their fathers they could no longer be redeemed to the land of their fathers. 
                They knew they could no longer be redeemed to the land of Jerusalem, so the higher idea of spiritually redemption was important to their people. 
            </p>

            <p>As I have understood the real meaning of Redeem and Redeemer, it has changed my perspective of what this name of Christ means. I have read the Book of Mormon differently understanding
                 now what they must be feeling, not believing they can be redeemed to such an part of their identity. Just as the Nephites though, I have a greater appreciation knowing that Christ can and will
                  redeem us spiritually. He makes it possible for me to be redeemed from my fallen state, so that I can return to God. I am so grateful for this truth, and am glad Isaiah helped me better understand it.
