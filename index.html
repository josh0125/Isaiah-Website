        <h2>Isaiah</h2>

        <p>Isaiah is one of the most well known prophets of the Old Testament. He was a beautifully elegant writer that taught bold doctrines and used thoughtful symbolism. He is a prophet that has been quoted by many others prophets and often quoted by Jesus Christ, himself. Today we are searching the vision that
        Isaiah received and what it can teach us about the divine role of prophets in God's plan.</p>

        <h2>The Meaning of <i>Hazah</i></h2>

        <p>In <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/1?lang=eng" target="_blank">Isaiah 1:1</a>, Isaiah first references the vision he received and the interaction he experienced with God. Isaiah goes on to explain that this vision wasn't like others;
        it was much more than that. We see this because of the word that Isaiah uses to describe the word vision in this verse; the word was <i>hazon</i>. This word is different than other definitions of vision that are used in Hebrew. <i>Hazah</i> is related more to
        a revelatory experience, something that was deeper and more spiritual. The Vision that Isaiah was seeing is the Vision of creation from the beginning to the end that had been shared before. This showed more than just a moment, but showed the making of the universe and all the elements and people attached to it. 
        </p>

        <p>The Vision is also taught in <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/1?lang=eng" 
        target="_blank">Revelations 1:1</a>. We learn more here who gives this vision, or the revelation, to other prophets and why it is given to them. The verse says:</p>
        </p>
        
        <p class="margin"><i>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John</i>
        </p>
        <p class="margin"><i>Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.</i>
        </p>
        
        <p>Here Jesus Christ is given the authority from God to share the Vision with God's servants, or the prophets. Specifically the Book of Revelation, is the vision that Jesus Christ gives to John the Beloved. Each time the Vision is shared, Jesus expects that His servants will share it.
        Yet often the prophet is only asked to share only part of the Vision. Others prophets have experienced the Vision and focused on specific. 
        </p>

        <p>For example, here is Revelation, John focuses on the end times. Joseph Smith also recieved the Vision, but he focuses on the time after this life in <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng" target="_blank">Doctrine and Covenants 76</a>. 
        Prophets like Moses gave us a broad overview of the whole of creation. But all of these prophets were experincing the same vision, the <i>Hazah</i>.        with other prophets, it is the same vision that has been shared to all the prophets. 
        </p>

        </p>
      
        <p>The Vision is something that is important to understand because we can greater understand the things that Christ has shown His servants. We can also study the words of these prophets more intently so we can have a better understanding of the <i>Hazah</i>.</p>

          <h2>The Meaning of <i>Sod</i></h2>

          <p>After receiving the Hazah, Isaiah went on to preach and teach the people, but he later teaches us more about his call as a prophet in <a href="https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/6?lang=eng" target="_blank">Isaiah 6</a>. Here Isaiah expressed his feelings of 
            inadequacy. He is fearful of hearing God speak because he doesn't feel worthy to be in his presence. Here in this verse, we learn an important principle about how prophets get their authority. This is how the verse reads:
          </p>

          <p class="margin"><i>I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.</i></p>
        
        </div>

        <div class="image-wrapper">
          <figure>
            <img src="images/councilcolor.jpg" alt="council in color">

        </div>
      </article>

      <article class="panel">
        <div class="text-wrapper">

          <p>This is when Isaiah officially excepts his call as a prophet, but it is important for us to see what the Lord said. Here, He uses the word us. This implies that Isaiah was speaking to multiple people at once, almost like a Council. This idea connects to another word used throughout the scriptures, that word is <i>Sod</i>
            <i>Sod</i> is a Hebrew word that means "council", as in a council of multiple meeting and speaking together. 
            </p>
    
            <p>The word <i>sod</i> is used repeatedly throughout the scriptures to teach this principle. The word, <i>Sod</i>, is also used in <a href="https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/amos/3?lang=eng" target="_blank">Amos 3: 7</a>.</p>
            
        </div>

        <div class="image-wrapper left">
          <figure>

          </figure>
        </div>

      </article>

      <article>
        <p class="margin"><i>Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.</i></p>

        <p>The word secrets here is actually, <i>sod</i>, which again means council. This teaches that Christ will always show the Divine Council to a true prophet.</p>

        <p>Many examples of this can be found, like Lehi's first vision. He not only saw God but many other angels and disciples. Peter, James, and John also saw a council of
          angels of the Mount of Transfiguration. God shows the Divine Council unto His prophet.
        </p>

        <p>This is likely because it helps the prophet not feel alone. He knows that he has divine beings on his side that can help him through the difficulties and lonelines 
          that come with being a prophet. It also establishes their authority. They have a certain authority once they are called as a porhet and have the <i>Sod</i> revealed unto them.
          This is a vital step that a prophet needs to go through to become one of God's chosen servants.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>Isaiah teaches us many things about what it means to be a prophet of God. He teaches us that they must see the <i>Hazah</i>, which is revealed to them from Christ. 
        This knowledge gives them an ability to share God's teaching and plan with His children.</p>

        <p>It is also important that a prophet receives their commission through having the <i>Sod</i> revealed to them. The <i>Sod</i> establishes their authority as servants of the Lord
        and help them not feel alone when they feel inadequate and lonely. </p>

        <p>As we greater understand the calling of a prophet, we can better listen to and understand God's chosen servants. It has strengthened my testimony of the prophets of old and prophets to day because I understand these doctrines more.</p>
